# Updating the DeepLense Pipeline

Strong gravitational lensing is a potential way to learn more about dark matter's basic nature by probing its substructure.
The DeepLense pipeline combines state-of-the-art deep learning models with strong lensing simulations based on lenstronomy. The focus of this project is updating the previous results of DeepLense with new dark matter simulations (Models I, II, III).

 This is a PyTorch-based library for performing Regression, Classification, and Anomaly Detection tasks on the new dark matter simulation models. It is one of the projects under [Google Summer of Code 2022](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

 I have also written a blog post about my GSoC 2022 experience with this project. Check it out [here](https://medium.com/@saranga.boo/updating-the-deeplense-pipeline-gsoc-2022-with-ml4sci-deb9f20cc928).

## Datasets
The models are trained on mainly 3 datasets consisting of ~30,000 images (single channel) per class. The test sets contain 5000 images. All the dataset consists of 3 classes : 

- axion (vortex)
- no_sub (No substructure)
- cdm (point mass subhalos)

*Note: The Axion files have an extra datapoint corresponding to mass of axion used in simulation. This mass is used for the Regression task on the axion class of the Models.*

The links to the simulation data are available in the [DeepLenseSim](https://github.com/mwt5345/DeepLenseSim) repo.

### __Model_I__
- 150 x 150 dimensional images
